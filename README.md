This repo is the client-side/frontend of [https://www.teachieawards.com](https://www.teachieawards.com). It requires the backend/API server to be running:

[https://github.com/jonnylynchy/teachie-awards](https://github.com/jonnylynchy/teachie-awards).

This project is a website that gives teachers recognition in the form of a virtual award, the "Teachie". In the future users will be able to donate or solicit donations in the form of a gift card, or some form of small compensation in electronic format. 
Users could discreetly nominate a teacher and solicit others for votes. If the teacher acquires a certain number of votes, they will be selected to receive a “Teachie”. The award would be some simple artwork of an award or trophy with the teacher's name and a relevant category. It would be deliverable via email, Twitter, and Facebook.
